								<h2>Our Story continued ... </h2>
								<p>
									Suki was very easy to talk to and we'd spend time after class talking. I think it was in SS3 things stepped up a notch, with after school chats and then mid night calls.
								</p>
								<p>
									I doubted Suki's intentions for a long time because he was a "boarder boy" and they were notorious.  I'm sure I almost chewed Timilehin's ears off doing "due diligence".
								</p>
								<p>
									Last last on top all my hard girl, I liked the boy but alas he was going to Covenant University, the glorified secondary school ( I said what I said üòù) where mobile phones were prohibited. We promised to be friends and stay in touch via emails but someone wasn't replying my emails. üôÑ
								</p>
								<p>
									As a fine girl that I am (na them they rush us), lol, I dated quite a few people in uni. To be fair to Suki, whenever he was on vacation from his glorified secondary school he used to check on me and sometimes visit Ibadan and we'll catch up. He'll later tell me that he still liked me but didn't say anything because I was always "occupied". I just thought he was being a good friend and all.
								</p>
								<p>
									We stayed in touch over the years having quarterly catch ups and dated different people.I remember he came to visit me once when I was in Law School in Lagos that was very sweet of him. Also when I was in Abuja for my call to bar he was very helpful in helping me run errands.  Again i thought he was just being a good friend for old times sake.üòÅ
								</p>
								<p>
									We continued our friendship with random catch ups until one day in 2017, when Suki asked me for advice on a relationship and it struck me like wawu this boy is gonna marry someone else,as the good friend that I am, I gave him good advice. I guess I probably still liked him but I'd shelved the feelings and put him deep in the friend zone.
								</p>
								<p>
									The jury is still out on whether that question was to make me jealous üòù.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our friendship picked up from here. I'd just come out of a relationship and was revising for my bar transfer exams. Suki visited the UK in 2018 but I didn't really have time to hang out cos my exams were in about a month.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was nice to see each other in person again....
								</p>
								<p>
									He asked me out shortly after and I turned him down cos I wasn't emotionally ready for a relationship or I was just enjoying my baby girl life, lol. He went quiet for a while although we still stayed in touch.
								</p>
								<h2>Tidbits</h2>
								<b>Who made the first move?</b>
								<p>
									He made the first move when he texted me on New Years day. A few hours later we had plans for dinner that week.
